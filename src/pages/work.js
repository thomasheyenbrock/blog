        : The website of my skiclub, built with <i>ReactJS</i> and{" "}
        <i>Bootstrap</i>. The frontend applications talks to the server via a{" "}
        <i>GraphQL</i>-API. The application show events from the underlying
        database with online registration. It also contains a simple image
        galery.

        : Here you can play a bavarian card game (which is not rather well known
        I suppose ðŸ˜…). The application is still work-in-progress, you can
        currently only play against simulated opponents. In the future the app
        shall feature multi-player-mode.
        <br />
        The frontend is built with <i>ReactJS</i> and <i>TypeScript</i>. It is
        hosted with <i>Firebase</i>, which is also the platform that I used for
        authentication and as database. The application is a progressive web app
        and can be used completely offline.

        . (I did indeed win a t-shirt!) The application visualizes some data
        from the State-of-JS survey 2018. It is again built with <i>ReactJS</i>.

        : I build this application to try out <i>VueJS</i>. It's very simple,
        all the state lies in the client. No server, no database. I also used{" "}
        <i>TypeScript</i> here.
        <br />
        The game itself is very simple, kind of like Minesweeper. You have to
        color the box in the grid in such a way that there are as many colored
        boxes around a number as it tells you. (So e.g. all boxes around a{" "}
        <i>9</i> have to be colored.)
        <br />
        You can also jump to the solution if this is too much work for you. The
        solution is not stored anywhere but it is computed algorithmically on
        runtime.

          combine-utils

        : This package helps with combinatorical problems like combining
        multiple items of a collection together and creating sets of
        collections. The basis is a recursive function.

        <i>React Native</i>, <i>react-native-web</i> to compile the app for the
        web and <i>Electron</i> to compile the app as desktop application.
        <br />
        It has been a long time since I last touched this, so beware! I have no
        idea if everything still works. The package versions of the dependencies
        are probably heavily outdated as well.
